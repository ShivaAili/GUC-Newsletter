            <h2>Students without a visa can start one online <br/> course at UCW</h2>
            <p>Students outside Canada who have been issued a UCW Letter of Acceptance (LOA), are eligible to start one course online as of July 2020 without their VISA confirmation, based on the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The fee for the one course taken will be non-refundable. For example, if a student pays $7,900 deposit and takes one course at $2,340 tuition, the course is non-refundable but the remainder of the deposit, $5,560 will be refunded if the student’s visa is denied.</li>
                <li>Students outside Canada will be permitted to take one course only in this scenario. The deadline for the LOA to be issued, and for students to confirm if they choose to take this option, will be July 10, 2020.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please contact your Business Developer for more details.</p>
